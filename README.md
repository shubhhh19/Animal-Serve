# Animal-Serve

### Description:
Our project, "Animal-Serve," is a simple two-page web application that allows users to interact with a virtual zoo. Users can input their name, select an animal from a dropdown list, and submit their choices. Based on their selections, the application displays a personalized greeting along with an image and description of the chosen animal.

### Tools Used:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for front-end development
- CGI (Common Gateway Interface) for server-side processing in C/C++/C#
- PHP for server-side processing
- GitHub for version control and project hosting

### Features:
1. User-friendly interface: The application features a clean and intuitive user interface with clear instructions and validation prompts.
2. Dynamic content: Upon submission, the application dynamically generates personalized responses based on user input.
3. Image and text display: The selected animal's image and description are displayed neatly alongside the user's greeting.
4. Cross-browser compatibility: The application is tested and optimized for consistent performance across Microsoft Edge and Chrome browsers.

### Install and Run Instructions:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have a web server environment set up to run CGI and PHP scripts.
3. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
4. Open `cgi-zoo.html` and `php-zoo.html` in your preferred web browser to interact with the application.

### Interesting Parts during the Build Process:
- Implementing form validation using JavaScript to ensure that user input is accurate and complete.
- Integrating CGI and PHP scripts to handle server-side processing and generate dynamic content based on user input.

### Difficulties we had and how we overcame them:
1. **Server-side scripting**: Understanding and implementing CGI and PHP scripts posed a challenge initially, but thorough research and practice helped us overcome this obstacle. We referred to documentation and online resources to clarify concepts and troubleshoot issues.
2. **File organization**: Organizing image files and text descriptions for each animal in the `theZoo` sub-folder required careful planning. We developed a systematic naming convention and folder structure to streamline the process and ensure easy retrieval of assets during runtime.

### Future Updates and Fixes:
1. **Enhanced user experience**: Implementing additional CSS styles and animations to further enhance the visual appeal of the application.
2. **Expand animal database**: Adding more animals and corresponding descriptions to enrich the user experience and provide a broader range of options.
3. **Optimization**: Fine-tuning server-side scripts and client-side code for improved performance and scalability.
4. **Localization**: Adding support for multiple languages to cater to a diverse user base.
